# Claude Skills: Complete Video Transcript

## Introduction – The Power of Leverage

I have genuinely never been as productive as I am right now because of Claude's skills. This image really does sum it up. I feel like I'm working on multiple different computers and multiple different tasks at the same time without sacrificing quality. It just comes down to one simple word and that is leverage. With Claude skills or any agent skills for that matter, you have way more leverage than if you were doing this by yourself. So, in this video, I'm going to be breaking down what skills are, how they work, and how you can build really, really good ones, even if you've never heard of the concept or built a single skill ever before. So, let's hop into a live demo real quick and get going.

## Live Demo – Four Agents Running in Parallel

All right, so here we are in Claude Code in my Herk 2 project, which is kind of just like my personal assistant. Now, if this stuff over here looks overwhelming, don't worry about that right now. Just worry on what I'm actually asking the agent to do. So, I've got the skill that I called morning coffee that helps me plan my day every morning. So, it's not morning right now, but I'm going to run this so you can see how it works. So, as Cloud Code's figuring that out, what I'm going to do is open up another agent. And in this one, I'm asking it to run a pulse check on all my projects and commitments to see how things are going. I'm opening up another one to create me an Excal diagram of the difference between local AI models and closed source models. And let's just do one more that's going to scrape the comments from my recent YouTube videos and give me an analysis

on what I need to improve. So what you're looking at right now is four different agents running in parallel doing things for me. And that took me probably 30 seconds to ask them to do that. And because I built all of these skills, all of these agents have all of the context about my business, what's going on with our projects, my YouTube channel. It has literally everything it needs. And now all of those agents are done.

### Agent 1: Morning Coffee

Here was my February 26th morning coffee. I had three things on the calendar. So, what it's going to do is it's going to look at my ClickUp. It's going to see what else I've got this week and look at my tasks and then help me plan the rest of my day. So, this is the plan that it suggested. All I have to do is say, "Yep," and it would block off everything for me. And for me, that's huge because I don't have decision fatigue anymore of what I have to work on.

### Agent 2: Pulse Check

The second agent came back with a pulse check, 2 days until the end of the month. Here's where everything stands. So, obviously I'm going to blur all of this out, but it's basically catching me up on all of the different main initiatives that we're doing this month and this quarter and making sure that everything is on track. And right here, you can see there's a few things that I need to follow up on manually.

And this might have slipped through the cracks because I'm so busy making YouTube videos if I didn't have this personal assistant to check up on me using the skill.

### Agent 3: Excal Diagram

The third agent came back and has finished the Excal diagram and I pasted it in and it looks like this. So, if I needed to make a video about this, I wouldn't have had to take my own time to create this visualization.

### Agent 4: Comment Analysis

So, for the comment analysis, that came back and we can see all of the comments, all the views, and things that I need to address either in future videos or in the comments. We got some confusion. We've got some cost things that I need to cover. We have to stop demoing toy examples for tool videos. Seems like you guys really want to see some anti-gravity stuff. I promise that'll come soon. And then we've got top three priorities. So, I've been recording now this video for about 6 minutes. Just think about if I would have done all four of those things myself, how much context switching I would have done and how long that would have taken me.

## What Are Skills?

Okay, so now that you guys have seen an actual demo, and hopefully you're a little bit excited to learn about Cloud Skills if you haven't used them yet, what actually are they?

So, skills are reusable instructions.
You write them once, you save them as a skill. You can trigger them anytime, and you're going to get way more consistent results because it's going through that same process every time. So, this visual right here was actually an AI generated image that I used with a skill. It was this one right here in my Cloud Code called Excalibraw visuals. But sometimes with AI generated images, they don't spell words right. As you can see here, this is all messed up. This stuff is messed up. So, I also have one, as you saw in the demo, to create Excalaw diagrams. And this one creates the actual Excal that I could move and edit.

And the words are always perfect because it's actually just typing. And those two skills alone have saved me so much time.

And what I'm going to do, by the way, for all you guys, is in my free school community, the link for this is down in the description, I've added a new classroom section called agent skills where I'm just going to be dropping a ton of these skills that you guys can go grab for completely free.

## Why Should You Care?

So, before we dive into this today, just real quick, why should you care? And there's three big reasons. You can be way more productive as a person because you can automate things like you just saw me do.

And you can legitimately build a personal assistant that can do almost anything for you. The second one is team leverage. So you can turn existing SOPs into automations really, really easy.

And if you build something new, not just you can use it, but your entire organization can. So everyone as a group is getting way more productive, which will almost undoubtedly result in growth of the business. And also monetization.

We're entering this new world where skills are having a big moment and you're able to capitalize on a lot of this stuff. Now, I'm not saying this is going to be a viable business model for a long, long time. So, you shouldn't bank on it, but it is something to be aware of just like when people were selling edited in workflow templates and things like that. But once again, it just comes down to one word, which is leverage. This isn't just theory. This is something that we're seeing with clients. This is something that we're seeing internally in my own business.

This speed of work that we're able to achieve right now feels insane, but that is going to become normal. And if you can't do that, you instantly become way too slow and way too expensive for the business and they might not keep you around. We're actually making it a priority to make sure all of our employees are using cloud code because now I have all these different skills that I can just run with a simple slash command or a simple natural language prompt and get in one day a week's worth of output. Because once again, one person can figure out the best way to do something and turn it into a skill that the entire team can use.

## Skills Are Basically Automations

But they don't just generate text. They're basically automations. They can run scripts. They can call APIs. They can create things.
They can have sub agents. And they can be called on from agents as well. So this is truly AI automation. And just to really hammer it home, they're basically SOPs for your AI agents. The same way where you would train a human employee by letting them read through an SOP to understand the process and then they'd be able to do it. You just train an agent on it. You give them the skill, they read it, and then they do it. And the coolest part about it is the more you use the skill, the better and better it gets.

## The Anatomy of a Skill

So we've talked about a lot of these benefits, right? But what actually is a skill? Well, it's just a folder and it lives somewhere in your project. The most common example is probably going to be in your.claude/skills/skillname and then you've got like a skill MD or a markdown file. So, right here in my Herk 2 project, you can see up top we've gotclaude. I open up.claude, we have agents, rules, and skills. Right now, we're just talking about skills. If I open that up, we can see all the different skills that I've created in.

So, let's say for example, the Excal diagram skill. If I click into that, we have a skill.md. And when I open that up, you can see we have the name of the skill, the description, and then we have the actual workflow. Step one, understand the concept. Step two, plan the layout. Step three, generate elements. And this entire skill basically teaches my agent how to build these Excal diagrams for me. So, like I said, that is the anatomy of the skill.

### Front Matter (YAML)

We've got front matter, which is kind of between these two dotted lines, and that is in something called YAML, which you don't need to worry about what that means. This is just the way that it's kind of indicated, sort of like your markdown or your JSON or Python. Now, up here, we'll have a name and a description, which tells Claude Code what the skill is called and what the skill does. So, as you can see, this one is called Excalraw- Diagram. And there's a brief description about what it actually does or when to use it.

### Step-by-Step Rules (Instructions)

And then we have the step-by-step rules, which are basically the instructions.
And this is what Claude actually does once it decides that this is the right skill for the job.

## Adding More Data and Reference Files

Now the interesting thing about skills is that sometimes you need way more data. So for example, let's say we're writing a LinkedIn post.
We have a skill for that, right? But what needs to go in the skill is other information sometimes like a company tone of voice or maybe your LinkedIn, you know, tone of voice, a target avatar, current priorities, a logo.
Maybe there are other things that you want to put into a skill besides just like the step-by-step instructions that will make it better. So the question is, where do these things go? Well, there's typically two options, but essentially, as long as you're pointing to the right path in the skill.mmd, you're fine. So, let me explain what I mean by that, and then I'll show you what I mean by that.

### Option A: Self-Contained

So, first option is to have it self-contained. So, in yourcloud/skills/skll name, you can have the skill.md, you can have your scripts right there, and you can have your references right there.

### Option B: External References

Or option B is that they're not directly nested right under that skill. So, here we have.claude/skill/infographic Claude/skill/infographic in the skillmd and we still have our scripts and our references in the same project but it's just not nested directly under that skill and so I know that might have made no sense so let me show you exactly what I mean by that

### Example: Idea Mining Skill

okay so here we have a skill called idea mining and so what happens in here is basically used when someone asks for content ideas video ideas what to make next or to run idea mining and so in here I gave it some context right my channel has this many subs it's about AI automation my content pillars are naden rag agents cloud odd code, voice AI, and then what I gave it is a bunch of references. I gave it channel data, which is YouTube channel.md. I also gave it the raw data, which is a JSON file. I gave it a competitor list for me, and I gave it an actual script to run analysis on my YouTube channel. And so in this case, what you can see is that I went for option B where I'm storing those reference files and those scripts, not directly nested in this skill. So basically what it could look like is within the skill itself we could have a folder called you know references. We could also have a folder in here called scripts. And then within both of these subfolders we could have more things like you know in the references I could have channel data. And in the scripts I could have YouTube-analysis.js or py whatever it is. Basically the idea is it doesn't matter where those actual reference files or scripts live as long as you point to the right spot in the MD file. So in my case, where these actually live is in a different folder.

So here for the channel data, I would basically just go all the way down to references and then I could go down to right here, YouTube channel.md. So cloud code reads the skill and then it's able to find this if it needs it. Same thing for the scripts. It would go down here to scripts and then it would find analyze YouTube. py and it would just pull this in if it needed it.

### The Skill Builder Tool

So hopefully you guys are with me. However you want to set it up works. And I think that's the most overwhelming thing about cloud code right now is that everyone uses different kind of folder architecture. But don't worry guys, I'm totally on top of this. I have a skill that I built out called skilluer. And this one I'll be giving away for free once again in my free school community right here. And all you'd have to do is load in the skill builder and then it'll help you build out everything you need.

And I'll be showing a live demo of that in a few minutes here.

## Skill.md and Supporting Files

So the skill.md is the actual brain itself and the supporting files are the tools that it can use. That doesn't mean every single time the skill is invoked that those reference files will all be called. And just in case you guys were wondering if you've watched some of my previous cloud code videos where we've used the WAT framework to build automations, this is very very very similar in that framework. The W the workflows were the markdown file SOPs. That's basically the skill. The tools were the actual Python scripts and that's basically just the scripts that you might write or the references that you would add in. So if you've already been building some WAT stuff, you will pick up skills super super quickly.

## Where to Find Skills

The cool thing about skills is that you don't have to build all of them. Obviously, as you're working with cloud code and you're finding that you're doing things repetitively, you can go ahead and build a skill for it. But there's an official library from Anthropic of skills.
There's a community of everyone that's open sourcing their skills and giving them out. And there's a marketplace where you can share and sell or you know download skills from people. And then you would take that skill or that essentially a prompt and you would add your own flavor to it. The one thing I would say is just be careful and make sure that no one's trying to, you know, give you a skill that has any malicious intent in there. And all these skills can work across different products. So, cursor, anti-gravity, codeex, because it's so based in markdown and it's essentially just a prompt, tons of different AI models can use them.

## How Does Claude Know When to Use a Skill?

Okay.
So, how does Claude know when to use a skill? Well, there are two ways to actually trigger them. The first one is you can be explicit, which basically means you can do a slash command and say the skill name and it will just directly fire off that skill. Or it could just be natural language. So if I had a school post skill, I could say slashschool-post.
Or I could natural language just say, "Hey, help me write a school post about X." Claude would find that skill and then invoke it. So when you ask Claude to do something, it will first read through the cloud. MD file. It will analyze your request and it will search through the skills and see which one do I have that helps with this query. If it finds one, it will invoke it. But if it can't find anything, then it will basically just use its general knowledge. So not every single request that you give to cloud code will invoke a skill.

## Progressive Context Loading

Now a really important part of that is understanding how skills stay lightweight because if you've been using cloud code you know that context management is a huge deal. And if you had all of these skills to look through and all of these skills are I don't know hundreds and hundreds of lines then if cloud code was searching through all of these every single time that would surely eat up a ton of your tokens. So what's used is something called progressive context loading which basically means we have three levels.

### Level 1: Initial Search

Level one is the initial search where cloud code only looks for the name and the description. So right here you can see let's say we ask for an Excal diagram. It would basically search through all the skills but it would only read the YAML front matter. So it would read the name and the description. And typically this front matter is only going to be you know maybe roughly a 100 tokens. So it stays very lightweight.

### Level 2: Full Skill Read

And then moving down to level two let's say it identifies okay cool this is the right skill for the job. Then it would run the full skill.mmd and it would read through everything. And so that's when it would start to actually understand what goes on in the skill. And that might be anywhere from a thousand to a couple thousand tokens.

### Level 3: Load Extra Files Only When Needed

And then level three is once again a decision. Only load in the extra files when needed. So if I need to look at any scripts or references or templates or I need to pull in some brand assets or more context, I'm only going to do that if the specific requests requires it. And so hopefully now you're starting to understand a little bit more about under the hood what's actually going on when you ask cla code to do something for you. And you can always go to cloud code docs and go to the skills section and just read about how this stuff works.

It's really, really simple. On the doc itself, it will tell you just make sure to keep the skill.md under 500 lines.
Move detailed reference material to separate files.

## Building Skills Through Iteration

And so, I know this may seem like it's just a lot of information being thrown at you. So, let me just kind of contextualize this and slow it down and reassure you guys. You're never ever ever going to write a perfect skill the first try. The way that I build my skills is I have Claude Code do something with me. I walk it through the steps, you know, each time. And then when we're done, if we've went from point A to point B, I say, "Cool. This is something I do once a day. Let's turn this into a skill. Ask me more questions so we can make sure you have all the information you need." And once again, I'm going to show you guys opening up a brand new project and setting up a skill from scratch so you understand the full process, but I just had to give you guys some context first.

### The Feedback Cycle

Now, we have this thing called the feedback cycle, which basically means you invoke the skill, you actually watch the agent work, you give feedback, and then it fixes the skill, and then you do it again. And so, the first couple times you run a skill, you may feel like, eh, this feels very AI generated. But by the time you've run that skill 10, 20, 30 times, every single time it gets better. And so, that's why it's actually important to watch the agent work the first couple of times because that's how you're able to identify opportunities to speed it up and save tokens by doing things like this.

## Advanced Skill Examples

### Pulse Check Skill

So here's an example of the pulse check skill that we actually ran earlier. Now this skill gets invoked when I ask for a pulse check or checking in on commitments. And what it does is it reads through some context of how OTAAS work, which is important for it to understand every single time it reads the skill, which is why I put it here rather than a reference file. And what it has to do is it has to do a live lookup on my ClickUp to understand what's going on. So what I did is I hardcoded in these list IDs because when I was watching it, I realized every single time it was doing this, it was calling the ClickUp MCP and it was gathering all these lists and it was searching and parsing the results and then it would extract the ID and that just was taking so long and it was costing me a ton of tokens. So I realized that's always going to be the same. Why don't I just give it in the skill document the list IDs and now it knows how to do that instantly every time and it doesn't waste all those tokens. And on top of that, I know that searching through ClickUp can consume a lot of time and tokens. So, I built a specialized sub agent that in this skill, I say, "Hey, delegate to the ClickUp searcher agent with this query in order to do all of this searching so that you don't blow your own context window." All of that's handled over there and then you only get the information that you need. So, there's a lot of advanced things that you can do to manage your context. I'm not going to dive into all of that right now. We're just focusing on skills, but just wanted to give you a little taste of what's possible in the skill.md files.

### Skill Builder Skill

So, another good example of needing a reference doc like that is in my skill builder skill. I obviously use this when I'm creating new skills, optimizing skills, auditing skill quality, things like that. And a lot of the inspiration I got from this was of course straight from claude code docs itself about how to actually use and build and optimize skills. And so when I was building this out, I I was watching the agent, you know, run the skill and I realized it's searching every single time. It's doing a web search and it's crawling the entire document. even if I just need a little piece of information. So, what I decided to do was I told it to basically scrape that whole thing and then I gave it a reference.md which is basically the documentation. So, I've got my skill.md and what it does is it references that full file if it needs it.

## Key Principle: Markdown Over API Calls

But really, the main idea that I'm trying to drive home here is that processing markdown files for your agent is so much quicker and cheaper than actually making API calls or HTTP requests, you know, executing functions and reading tons and tons of tokens. So the goal is your skills will get to a place where you can invoke them, focus on something else for 10, 15 minutes or whatever, and then come back and have a finished result that is really, really good. But the first couple times that you are testing out a skill, I think it's a really good idea to just sit there and watch it and see what it's doing.

## When to Build a Skill

And a lot of people have asked me like, when do you know when to build a skill? Well, basically just go about your work. And if you ever realize that you've done something already or you've instructed something differently, like I tell my claude to not use m dashes. Okay, well that's probably a good idea to put that in the prompt, right? So, if you ever find yourself doing a process or repeating prompts, then that's probably a good use case to build a skill around it because skills don't have to be complex. They could literally just be a 50line markdown file.

## The Six-Step Skill Building Framework

All right, so we're about to hop into a live build of a skill from scratch, but what I wanted to do real quick was go over the six-step skill building framework.

1. **The Name and the Trigger** — What is it called? And the natural language that would basically fire it off.
2. **The Goal** — So, in one sentence, what will this skill accomplish by the end? What will be the output?
3. **The Step-by-Step Process** — If you had to do something manually exactly what do you do in what order? What do you look at? And what decisions do you make?
4. **The Reference Files** — What context do you need? Do you need images? Do you need understanding of current projects, current priorities? Do you need style guides? What do you need to do the job well?
5. **The Rules** — Think about what could go wrong and then the agent can help you build in guardrails and constraints around that.
6. **The Self-Improvement Loop** — And then number six is kind of like after you've built it, it's just the self-improvement loop. And after the live build, I'm going to talk about actually testing and iterating and what you need to do to make them really, really good.

But for now, that's the sixstep skill building framework. Let's hop into a live build.

## Live Build – Setting Up From Scratch

Okay, so here we are in Visual Studio Code, which is where I like to use Cloud Code. If you don't have Visual Studio Code, just go ahead to a browser, type in VS Code, and then go ahead and download this. This is what it will look like. If it's your first time using cloud code in here, you just have to go to extensions on this lefth hand side, type in cloud code, and then install this and then log in with your paid anthropic subscription. Now, after that, you're going to click on this top left button, and it's going to pull up this little thing that says you have not yet opened a folder. What you need to do is open up a project to work in. So, you could either open up one that you're already working on, or you could go ahead and create a new folder, and then open that one up. For the sake of the demo, I just opened up a new blank folder called a bunch of skills.

And I'm going to show you exactly what to do. So, the first step is to go to my free school community link in the description. Go to the agent skills classroom and download the skilluer folder. Once you've got those files ready to go, first thing we want to do is just set up this workspace real quick. Initialize this project with a simple.cloud/skills structure. Cool. So, as you can see, that got set up. We have aclad. We have a skills folder. And what I'm going to do is in this skill folder, I'm going to create a new folder called skill dash builder and hit enter. And then I'm going to take those two files from my school community, the reference and the markdown, and I'm going to put that right in here. So now we have this skill builder set up with the reference file and the actual skill markdown. I'm asking it if it can see that new skill that I just added. It says yes, I can see it. And I'm basically just going to say, cool, let's run that skill to build a new one together.

### Running the Skill Builder

So now you can see what it did is it basically is reading the skill right now. This is the instructions that we saw right in here.
As you guys know, since that's how skills work, it starts to read this. So, here we go. I built this skill to actually ask you questions so that it's way easier for you to communicate what you want. So, the first thing is what problem are you trying to solve? What we want to do is content creation because in this skill, what I want to do is building branded infographics. What kind of content does the skill create? What's the specific use case or workflow? And I'm actually just going to choose other for this. And I'm going to say educational infographics. Now, it's asking how we should trigger this skill.
So, does it want to be natural language or do we want to just use slash commands? And I'm just going to say both is fine. And now we're moving on to the step-by-step process, which is really important because at this point, we haven't told it what text we actually want to use or anything else about our business. So, walk me through what should happen from trigger to output.
And it has some good guesses. But what I'm going to do is do other and explain this the way that I want it built.

### Defining the Workflow

I will tell you what I want an infographic about. You will create a concept. You will make a request to key.ai AI to use Nano Banana to generate the outline or sorry to generate the image and you will also look at the brand guidelines that I give you so that everything that is created follows my brand colors and typography and stuff like that. The output format that I actually want is a PNG, not any of this stuff. Does this need to be conversational or fire and forget? I'm just going to go fire and forget. All right. So, how does the Key AI Nano Banana integration work? Is it an API call? Yep, we're just going to go with an API call. And in these options, you could literally say, I don't know.
Let's try different things, you know, help me figure out what's best. It's asking where those brand assets live.
So, I'll put them in a folder. And where should the generated PNG infographic be saved? Yeah, sure. Let's start a new folder called projects. And we'll throw all of them there. So, it's going to keep our project organized as well. So, now it's asking about brand guidelines.

### Adding Brand Assets

I created this folder and I put in our kind of color scheme as well as the actual AIS logo. I have put in both our AIS brand guidelines and the AIS logo. I want to make sure that in the top left corner of every single infographic that's created, the AIS logo appears exactly as I've given you. But I think you guys get the point here. I'm going to answer a few more questions and then I'll just show you when we have a result.

### Skill Creation Complete

And now that we've done that, what you can see is it is going to create the skill. It's going to create the logo overlay. It's going to create a supporting reference markdown file for all of the API details that it's going to need. So that's great. It's going to register the skill in claw.md and it's going to log its decisions. All right, so it fully built the skill. It created all those files for us. We just have to give it a key API key so we can actually run this.

### Testing the Skill

Okay, so I threw in my API key and then I said test it out with an infographic about cloud skills. That's it. No other context. It invoked the skill right here and we will see what happens. Okay, this is really interesting. So what it's doing is it is generating the image and then it's just going to overlay the logo. So it's going to be a lot more consistent than giving the AI image generator Nano Banana my logo. So I didn't even tell it to do that. Let's see how it looks. Okay.

Well, I don't love this. We're just going to go back and ask it to change some things. The logo on the top left doesn't look great. I gave you a logo with a transparent background, so it should just be overlaid on top and we should be able to see the background behind it. The actual infographic itself is all right, but I actually want these to always be one by one aspect ratio.

### Iterating on the Skill

Okay, so I made some suggestions and it's going to try again and it's going to update its skill. So, we'll see if that's better. All right, so second time we run the skill. Let's see if it's any better. All right, there we So, we've got the logo up top. We've got cloud code skills, custom AI workflow, command prompt, trigger, front matter, config triggers, AI agent delegation, document output. So, just keep in mind, all we said was build an infographic about cloud skills. And this was run number two. Every single time that we do this cycle, remember we talked about the feedback, we would basically watch it again, give more feedback, and then keep going. And after we run this probably five or six more times, this would be really, really good. And then every time I ask for an infographic, it's going to be consistent.

### What Was Built

And just to show you guys what was actually built, if we open up the infographic builder skill, we have the actual skill itself. So we have the front matter right here, the name, the description, we've got what the skill does. We've got context. So here's where it links to the actual brand guidelines and logos. We've got the step-by-step workflow right here. And we can see right here for full API reference and parameters, just see the markdown file so that you don't have to actually go search the web and search through a bunch of tokens. You can just read this markdown file. All right.

## Testing, Iterating, and Debugging

All right, so we've talked about a lot of stuff about skills today and we just built one live.
So what I want to talk about now is really how do you bridge the gap from like a 90% good skill to making it pretty much 100%. So testing, iterating, and debugging. There's different symptoms and there's different fixes. So let's just kind of go down this list one by one.

- **It does the wrong steps or in the wrong order** — Well, you would just tell it to edit the skill.md instructions.
- **Missing tone, style, or context** — In that case, you're going to add reference files. And of course, those have to be pointed to correctly in the skill. MD.
- **The same mistake happening over and over** — Then you're going to add a rule.
- **It struggles with a tool or an MCP or it keeps searching for the same things** — Then create some sort of reference dock for it.
- **It works good, but it could get better** — Then that just means you have to brute force it. You have to just run it over and over and over and keep nitpicking at what it does wrong, or maybe not wrong, but what it could improve on.
- **The skill isn't triggering** — Then check the YAML and make sure it is specific enough.
- **The skill triggers too often** — Then maybe try disabling model invocation.

And that is something that you can see in the claw docs, which basically gives you control over if the skill can only be invoked by natural language or only be invoked by the slash command directly, or both.

## Advanced Front Matter Options

So, like I said, if you want to look at some more advanced stuff, then definitely head over here to the actual doc. But at this point, we've covered almost everything about these skills. One thing that I would call your attention to is the actual front matter reference because we saw the name and the description, which is what's required every time, but there's lots of other things that you can add in there. Here's the disable model invocation like we just saw. But you can also give it allowed tools. You can also give it an argument hint. You can give it a specific model to use. You can give it specific context. You can give it hooks.
You can give it a specific agent. And so all of this lets you get really, really granular on the exact skill and how you want it to be used. But don't get overwhelmed. You really only get to that point once you've ran the skill a ton of times.

## Local vs. Global Skills

Now, another thing that I need to hit on real quick is where do skills actually live? because what we've seen so far is just building them right in ourcloud/skills folder. But when you're doing this, they only exist in that specific project. So whether that's my her 2 or my, you know, the one we just spun up, if I went to a different folder, that skill would no longer be able to be accessed by our cloud code.

But you can also create skills that are actually global. And you do that by doing that in a different directory in your kind of overall home directory. And that's basically indicated by the little tilda right here. And so that means every product you use in cloud code, no matter where you are, that skill would exist. So for example, I have a front-end design skill that is installed globally so that whenever I'm anywhere, if I need to do front-end design, it just is able to use it.

And just in case you want to look at it in a different way, right now what we're doing is we have our projects, right? So herk 2 and then we havecloud and then within dotcloud we have skills and then your skill and then your MD, your references, whatever, and then maybe another skill.

But if it was global, you might not actually see it in your project. It would just be within your overall home directory. So the reason why you might want to do this is if there's something very specific about you, your business, your workflows that you want applied to every single project, no matter what, maybe your company context, your company projects, your tone of voice, whatever, then you can install that globally instead.
